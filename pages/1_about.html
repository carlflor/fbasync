  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  Every Sunday, we celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist with joy and reverence. We commune together in worship and fellowship. Thereâ€™s a practical and relevant talk, rooted in the Word of God. Every day has become a practice of what we learn at church, and we bring the experience of The Feast Mall of Asia to where we are: our homes, workplaces, friends, and organizations. We grow deeper in relationship with God through the sacraments, daily meditation on the Word, and personal prayer time. We grow deeper in relationship with one another through friendship and fellowship, worshiping together in word and in deed. Together, we are home with God and with one another.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      Our home started in 2015 as an offshoot session of the growing the Feast Bay Area, a Catholic gathering of the Light of Jesus Family, under the leadership of Bro. Bo Sanchez.
      <br><br>
      First known as the Feast Bay Area SYNC (which had stood for Singles and Youth in Christ), its first builder was Bro. Migs Ramirez. This feast was intended to be the home Feast of the singles and youth of the Feast Bay Area. When God called Bro. Migs to the priestly vocation, another leader was appointed for the FBA SYNC.
      <br><br>
      In July 2016, Bro Didoy became the builder of the Sync. With the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the FBA Sync was redirected to a more encompassing mission: to make disciples by connecting with God and with one another. It has become the home Feast not only of the singles and youth of the Feast Bay Area, but more so of everyone who needs Christ.
      <br><br>
      By December 2017, with the growth of the Sync family, our home transitioned to the Mall of Asia. Our home has now become the Feast Mall of Asia, where Jesus takes the center stage and where you are loved.
