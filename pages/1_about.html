  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  Every Sunday, we celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist with joy and reverence. We commune together in worship and fellowship. Thereâ€™s a practical and relevant talk, rooted in the Word of God. Every day has become a practice of what we learn at church, and we bring the experience of The Feast Bay Area Sync to where we are: our homes, workplaces, friends, and organizations. We grow deeper in relationship with God through the sacraments, daily meditation on the Word, and personal prayer time. We grow deeper in relationship with one another through friendship and fellowship, worshiping together in word and in deed. Together, we are home with God and with one another.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      Our home, the Sync, started in 2015 as an offshot session of the growing The Feast Bay Area, <u>a Catholic gathering of the Light Of Jesus Family</u>, under the leadership of Bro. Bo Sanchez.
      <br><br>
      Initially led by Bro. Migs Ramirez for a year, The Feast Bay Area Sync stood for Feast Bay Area Singles and Youth in Christ. When God called Bro. Migs to the priestly vocation, antoher leader was appointed for the Sync.
      <br><br>
      Since July 2016, Bro. Didoy Lubaton has led Sync. With the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, The Feast Bay Area Sync was redirected to a more encompassing purpose: to connect with God and with one another
